# 🐾 Animal Image Classification

## 📋 Project Description  
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that classifies animal images into different categories (e.g., 🐱 cats, 🐶 dogs, 🐦 birds, etc.).  
This is a **multi-class image classification** task where the objective is to accurately predict the class of the animal shown in the image.

## 🔄 Workflow

### 🔎 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Inspect dataset size and class distribution  
- View random samples from each class  
- Analyze image shapes and channels  
- Check for class imbalance  

### 🧹 2. Data Preprocessing

- Resize and normalize images  
- Apply augmentation techniques  
- Encode labels (integer or one-hot)  
- Split into training, validation, and test sets  

### 🏋️ 3. Model Training

- Try CNN architectures (e.g., ResNet, VGG)  
- Use pretrained models + fine-tuning  
- Apply dropout, regularization  
- Early stopping and learning rate scheduling  
- Tune hyperparameters with `GridSearchCV` or manually  

### 📊 4. Evaluation

- Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
- Confusion matrix  
- Visualize loss and accuracy over epochs  

### 📤 5. Prediction and Submission

- Predict classes on the test set  
- Save predictions to CSV or JSON format  
- Use for competition submission or deployment
